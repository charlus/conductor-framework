## [Unreleased] — V6 Enforcement & Autonomy Rebalance

Implements `docs/adr/0001-enforcement-and-autonomy-rebalance.md`. The autonomy-backend (deterministic loop driver, adapters, sandbox/isolation, autonomy slider, swarm) is now built — see `docs/roadmap/Autonomous-Loop-Backend.md`; only a published/maintained turnkey sandbox image and a real-LLM CI run remain.

### Added
- **Deterministic enforcement hooks (D1)** — `.agents/hooks/` ships a Test-Driven-Law `pre-commit` (blocks implementation changes with no test change) and a Verification-Iron-Law `pre-push` (blocks a push whose verification command fails). Logged escape hatches (`CONDUCTOR_NO_TEST`, `CONDUCTOR_SKIP_VERIFY`, `CONDUCTOR_HOOKS=off`) and an opt-in interactive Claude Code Stop hook. Wired by the new `conductor install-hooks` command, auto-run by `init`/`upgrade` in a git repo. Prose laws are now backed by code.
- **Claude Code slash-command bridge (D5)** — `init`/`upgrade` generate `.claude/commands/<name>.md` shims per workflow, so `/build`, `/carve`, `/spec-it`, … work natively in Claude Code. Derived from the installed workflow set; stale shims pruned by marker; foreign commands preserved.
- **`domain-modeling` skill (D6)** — active ubiquitous-language discipline producing a living `conductor/4-context/meta/domain-model.md`; wired into Technical Vision (name the domain before the data model).
- **`subagent-isolation` skill** — the scout pattern: delegate read-heavy discovery, parallelize independent investigations, isolate mutating work in worktrees.
- **`model-routing` skill** — match model tier + reasoning effort to task difficulty.
- **Registry supply-chain scanning** — `conductor add` scans downloaded `SKILL.md` for prompt-injection/secret/dangerous-shell patterns; critical findings block install unless `--allow-unsafe`.

### Added — Autonomous Loop Backend (`conductor loop`, Phases 1–4)
- **Deterministic driver (Phase 1)** — `conductor loop` subcommand over a pure, testable state machine (`src/loop/driver.js`): the host runner owns the iteration ceiling, wall-clock budget, driver-observable stall detection (git HEAD + verify output), the Evidence Rule (verification exit code forces the verdict), the Scoping Barrier, and fail-safe verify resolution (mirrors the pre-push hook's `conductor_verify_cmd`). `loop-state.json` schema v2 (auto-migrates v1 on load). Replaces the V5 `scripts/run-conductor-loop.js` stub (deleted).
- **Platform adapters (Phase 2)** — the driver is platform-agnostic; registry/resolver (`src/loop/adapters/`) with **Claude Code** (primary), **Antigravity**, and **Codex** adapters. Selection: `--platform` → `loop-state.json.platform` → auto-detect.
- **Isolation (Phase 3)** — git-worktree isolation for the Maker; the independent **Checker as a separate process** (verdict via `checker-verdict.json`, fail-safe reject); document-only sandbox gate (`sandbox: none|container` + `templates/.agents/sandbox/`; L3 refused without a container → `halted_sandbox_required`).
- **Autonomy slider + merge + swarm (Phase 4)** — L0–L3 enforced in the driver (L0 interactive-only, L1 single-beat → `awaiting_review`, L2 blueprint-only, L3 execution); **PR-gated merge** via `gh`/`glab` (never a direct push); auditable action trail to `0-compass/ship-log.md`; **multi-vote adversarial Checker** (`checker_votes`, majority); and the opt-in **swarm** (`src/loop/swarm.js`: task-graph blackboard, frontier scheduler, specialized roles, concurrent Makers, serialized PR-gated merge queue). `concurrency=1` reproduces the pair exactly.
- **Maker completion signal** — the Maker writes `maker-signal.json`; the driver reads it from disk (never trusts clobberable in-memory state), symmetric with the Checker verdict.

### Changed
- **Carve** — tracer-bullet first-slice guidance (walking skeleton over foundation-first) and a ubiquitous-language naming rule.
- **`unattended-loop` / `loop-guardrails` reconciled** — the soft layer no longer performs driver-owned bookkeeping (iteration/stall counters, `maker_active`, in-context Checker); the driver is the authority, the prose is guidance.
- **`loop-guardrails` demoted (D2)** — from `always_on` to loop-scoped; loaded explicitly by the `unattended-loop` workflow, so interactive sessions don't pay for it.
- **Refactor at review stage (D10)** — `code-review` Stage 2 gains a cross-cutting refactoring pass that complements (never replaces) the mandatory per-increment REFACTOR in the TDD loop.

### Tests
- Self-test grows to ~112 checks (new skills, enforcement hooks, slash-command bridge, loop backend + v2 schema).
- New `node:test` unit suite for the loop backend (`npm run test:unit`, 60 cases — driver, adapters, isolation, autonomy, merge, swarm; no agent CLI spawned) and an end-to-end smoke test with a fake agent (`npm run test:smoke`).

## [4.2.0] — 2026-03-12

### Changed
- **`.conductor/` wrapper** — All numbered folders (0-Compass through 6-Archive) now live inside `.conductor/` for a clean project root. Updated all 16 framework files.
- **`ai-init.md` → `AGENTS.md`** — Renamed to industry-standard convention and moved to `.agent/AGENTS.md`. Removed `.agent/rules/` folder.
- **Platform stubs** — Created `GEMINI.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at root for auto-discovery by platform-specific AI tools.
- **Build Phase 4 (Ship & Close)** — Rewritten with 6 structured steps. New "Document to Platform" step detects git hosting via CLI auth and handles: issue updates/closing, release notes, wiki/documentation updates.

### Added
- **NPX installer** — `npx conductor-framework init` scaffolds the full framework. Supports `--force` and `--agent-only`.
- **README.md** — Package README with install instructions and credits to all source frameworks.
- **Dynamic Skill Loading** — Parked as backlog item for V5.

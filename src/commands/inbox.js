// src/commands/inbox.js

// `conductor inbox add "…"` — deterministic quick capture.
//
// WHY A COMMAND AND NOT A RULE. `Inbox: X` already existed as a row in the
// always-on request classifier, and it did not fire reliably. That is the
// expected outcome for a prose instruction competing with everything else in
// context — the framework's own operating rule is to enforce with code wherever
// the rule is mechanical. Appending a line to a file is as mechanical as it
// gets, so it becomes a command that cannot be forgotten, reworded, or triaged.
//
// The prose rule stays as a fallback for platforms without the CLI on PATH.

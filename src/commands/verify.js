// src/commands/verify.js
//
// `conductor verify` — the one command that answers "what does `git push` run
// here, and how do I change it?"
//
// WHY. The push gate is the framework's central enforcement bet, and until now
// the only way to configure it was to know that a `verify` key exists, in a file
// that `upgrade` did not always create. The maintainer — who helped build the
// feature — could not act on the warning. A safety switch nobody can find is
// not a safety switch.
//
// Setting a command RUNS it first. A gate configured with a command that cannot
// pass is worse than no gate: it blocks every push and teaches the operator to
// reach for CONDUCTOR_SKIP_VERIFY.

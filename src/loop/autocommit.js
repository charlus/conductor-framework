// src/loop/autocommit.js
//
// Commit-before-teardown backstop (Loop-Robustness P0.1). The single fix that
// closes the observed data-loss chain: a Maker that creates files but skips its
// `git commit` would otherwise (a) let verify pass on the working tree while the
// committed diff stays empty, (b) leave the Checker with no diff to review, and
// (c) have its work destroyed when the worktree is force-removed on teardown.
//
// After every Maker beat the IO shell calls this to capture any uncommitted
// change into a commit, so the rest of the pipeline sees real, durable work. It
// is a no-op when the tree is already clean (the Maker committed properly).
//
// Inspired by agentctl's `ag-merge` auto_commit (stage → conventional message →
// commit). Pure over an injected git runner: `git(args) -> {ok, stdout}`.
//
// 2026-10-22: with `expect: {path}`, it commits only in that worktree, on a loop
// branch. A worktree removed under a live run leaves a plain folder inside the
// owner's checkout, where `git add -A` would commit onto the owner's branch.

// src/loop/checker.js

// The independent Checker's verdict contract (Phase 3). The Checker runs as a
// SEPARATE process with a fresh context (structural independence) and records its
// verdict to a file — a `claude -p` process exit code is always 0 on success, so
// it cannot itself carry the verdict. The driver reads that file back.
//
// Fail-safe by construction (Evidence Rule): anything other than an explicit,
// well-formed `{"approved": true}` is treated as a REJECT. No approval evidence
// ⇒ not approved. This keeps a crashed/confused/silent Checker from waving work
// through.

 * The rubric-v2 evidence bar, in code (E3).
 *
 * `.agents/skills/independent-review/reviewer.md` says a BLOCKER needs a
 * quoted line and confidence >= 7, so an unsure Checker DOWNGRADES rather than
 * rejecting. Prose is advisory; this enforces it.
 *
 * DIRECTION IS EVERYTHING (Operating Truth 4). The bar may only ever make the
 * gate stricter or leave it unchanged. A malformed BLOCKER is malformed — it
 * does NOT become an approval, because "write a sloppy finding to get waved
 * through" would invert the whole point. What the bar buys is a DIAGNOSTIC: the
 * driver can tell an evidenced rejection from a Checker rejecting on vibes, and
 * the latter is a Checker problem, not a Maker problem.
 *

 * @returns {string|null} what is wrong with it, or null when it is well-formed

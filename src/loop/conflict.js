// src/loop/conflict.js
//
// Merge-conflict PREDICTION for the swarm's merge queue (F7).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The swarm dispatched a wave of Makers in parallel worktrees,
// then merged them one by one. A collision was only discovered at merge time —
// after the worker had burned a full beat, passed verify and passed the
// Checker — and it surfaced as "PR-gated merge failed: unknown", which tells
// the human nothing about what collided. `git merge-tree` answers the same
// question against the object store, touching no working tree, so the queue can
// land the clean branches first and escalate the colliding one with the exact
// file list.
//
// NOT A SAFETY GATE. The PR-gated merge is still the real gate; this only
// reorders the queue and improves the escalation message. So it FAILS OPEN: an
// old git, a missing merge base, any doubt at all → `method: "unknown"` and
// `conflicted: false`, and the merge is attempted exactly as before. A false
// "conflicted" would strand work that merges fine, which is the worse error.
//
// TWO FORMS, because git changed the command:
//   git >= 2.38  `merge-tree --write-tree --name-only` — exit 1 means conflict.
//   git <  2.38  `merge-tree <base> <ours> <theirs>`   — ALWAYS exits 0; the
//                only signal is a conflict marker in the diff body. Reading the
//                exit code on this form reports every conflict as clean.
//
// All git IO is injected as `git(argsArray) -> {ok, stdout, stderr, exitCode}`.

 *
 *   TEXT CONFLICT   a `changed in both` / `added in both` section whose hunk has
 *                   a line that is exactly `+<<<<<<< .our`. Two branches editing

 *                   and merge fine — the header alone would over-report.
 *   MODIFY/DELETE   a `removed in remote` / `removed in local` section where the
 *                   surviving side's blob differs from base. No markers are ever
 *                   written for this one, which is why a marker-only reading
 *                   missed it.
 *
 * Every other section — `added in remote`, `merged`, … — cannot conflict, even
 * when its content happens to contain marker text.

// Cross-run self-improvement (P2.1) — Conductor's answer to agentctl's
// `process_improver`. After a run, mine the DURABLE, cross-run failure trail (the
// ship-log, appended every run) for patterns that recur >= a threshold, and
// surface them as a review doc proposing project-specific rules. The `.agents/
// rules/*.md` files auto-load every beat, so a recurring failure that a rule
// could prevent is exactly the leverage point.
//
// Deliberately PROPOSE, don't auto-mutate: a rule changes EVERY future beat, so
// an auto-generated one landing unreviewed could quietly derail the whole fleet.
// Detection is deterministic + pure here; a human (or a gated agent step) decides
// what actually becomes a rule. Guarded by agentctl's >=2-occurrence threshold so
// a one-off blip never becomes a rule.
//
// Pure: parse/cluster/render take strings and return values. loop.js does the IO.

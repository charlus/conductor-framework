// I6 (owner, 2026-10-23): the loop writes for the owner, never into git. Its
// messages, its run reports, the question rounds waiting for an answer and its
// improvement proposals stay where the owner and an agent find them, under
// conductor/1-workbench/, and git's local exclude file hides them, so
// `git status` in the owner's folder stays clean and nothing reaches a commit.
// Before 6.52.0 the loop appended its escalations to the tracked inbox.md.

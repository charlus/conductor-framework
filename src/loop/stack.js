// The stacked run (owner, 2026-10-22): "I run the Discovery, up to the Technical
// Vision. Then I run the loop on the result and it executes all the steps and
// workflows the framework defines, and ships the thing I asked to ship." One
// `conductor loop <project>` builds the Carve and every slice without waiting
// for a merge. Each item starts from the branch of the item below it, and each
// MR targets that branch, in both repositories. The owner merges the stack in
// order at the end; the forge moves each MR to the default branch when the one
// below it is merged (its source branch deleted on merge).
//
// One-way doors stay the owner's: an item that raises a question round stops
// the run, and nothing is built above it.
//
// The stack is recorded in the project's run directory (`stack.json`, in the
// repository's git directory, never in the owner's folder) and checked against
// the forge at the start of every run: an MR the owner closed is rebuilt with
// every item above it; an MR the owner changed is kept as the owner left it and
// every item above it is rebuilt on top. Merged items are never touched.
// Pure except where a function takes injected IO.

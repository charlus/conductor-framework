// src/loop/trigger.js
//
// The IGNITION contract for the Conductor autonomous loop.
//
// The driver (src/loop/driver.js) is a GOAL loop: it runs until a stop
// condition is met. It has no scheduler and no event ingestion — by design.
// The 2026 field consensus is "don't overshoot the tooling"; Claude Code
// already ships `/schedule`, and cron exists on every host. So instead of
// building our own scheduler, we expose a thin, safe way for ANY external
// trigger (a `/schedule`, a cron line, a CI/webhook shim) to SEED the loop's
// goal before it runs. That composition is what turns the goal loop into the
// TIME-based and PROACTIVE loops of Anthropic's Loop-Engineering taxonomy —
// see docs/roadmap/Loop-Engineering-Alignment.md.
//
// SAFETY (rubric §5.5 — a trigger payload may originate from untrusted input,
// e.g. a Slack message or a GitHub issue body):
//   • A trigger may SET the goal, the phase, and free-form context.
//   • A trigger may REQUEST an autonomy level, but it is CLAMPED to the
//     operator-set ceiling already in loop-state.json — a payload can DE-escalate
//     but NEVER escalate. Privilege comes from the operator, not the event.
//   • The context is written to the workbench as data for the Maker to read,
//     never spliced into the driver's control flow.

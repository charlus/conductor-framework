// src/loop/untrusted.js
//
// The trust envelope for external trigger content (E4).
//
// THREAT MODEL. `conductor loop` can be seeded from a GitHub issue body, a PR
// comment, a Slack message or a webhook (see src/loop/trigger.js). Anyone who
// can file an issue can therefore put text in front of an UNATTENDED agent that
// holds credentials. This is not hypothetical: the Feb-2026 Cline incident
// turned one malicious issue title into an npm supply-chain compromise, and
// April 2026 disclosed the same class in Claude Code's security-review action
// (CVSS 9.4), Gemini CLI Action and Copilot's coding agent. The shared root
// cause every write-up names: untrusted content processed in the same context
// as trusted instructions.
//
// DESIGN RULES (deliberate, and each one is load-bearing):
//
//   1. ENVELOPE ALWAYS. A clean pattern scan is not proof that content is safe.
//      The detector only adds louder labels; the wrapper is unconditional.
//   2. NORMALIZATION IS FOR DETECTION ONLY. NFKC folding plus stripping Unicode
//      format characters defeats fullwidth/zero-width evasion while MATCHING,
//      but the emitted content is never rewritten — a human reading the trigger
//      doc must see exactly what the author wrote.
//   3. DEFUSE FORGED SENTINELS. Attacker content containing our own BEGIN/END
//      banner would otherwise close the envelope early. A zero-width space is
//      spliced into the copy so it still renders visibly but no longer matches
//      the banner the model anchors on.
//   4. PRIVILEGE COMES FROM THE OPERATOR, NEVER THE EVENT. An untrusted author
//      may SET a goal; it may never raise autonomy. It is clamped to the
//      no-merge floor, so the worst case is a branch a human must review.
//   5. ALLOWLIST, NOT BLOCKLIST. Every published bypass of these agents defeated
//      a blocklist (`/proc/*/environ` instead of `env`, git push instead of
//      curl). An untrusted beat gets an explicit, small allowlist instead.
//
// This module is PURE (no IO, no state) so every rule above is unit-testable.

// src/review/server.js
//
// The loopback server behind `conductor review` (F4, slice 1).
//
// The agent blocks on one call; the human opens a page, reads, and decides;
// the call returns their verdict as JSON. That is the whole contract.
//
// Deliberately NOT a detached daemon. ECC runs a shared background server on a
// fixed port keyed by artifact path, which buys "feedback survives an
// interrupted await" at the cost of a port registry, a queue and a lifecycle
// nobody owns. Slice 1 keeps the server inside the waiting process: one
// artifact, one wait, ephemeral port. The agent runs it as a background Bash
// call and reads the JSON when it exits.
//
// Slice 2 removed the sharp edge that choice had. Every record is appended to
// a per-artifact queue (./store.js) before the response is sent, and a re-run
// replays it — so an interrupted wait costs the human a re-run, not their
// words. The page is still live only while the command runs; what changed is
// that clicking into a dead server is no longer silently lost.

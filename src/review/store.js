// Feedback that survives an interrupted wait (F4, slice 2).
//
// Slice 1's stated cost was that the server lived inside the waiting process:
// if that process died, the human's click died with it — and from their side
// of the glass, clicking simply appeared to do nothing. That is the worst
// failure this tool can have, because it is silent and it looks like the tool
// working.
//
// So every record is appended to a per-artifact queue before the response is
// sent, and a re-run picks the queue up. NDJSON, because an append is one
// write and a half-written tail costs one record rather than the file.
//
// SAFETY NET, NOT MECHANISM. Every function here swallows its errors: losing
// the queue costs the queue, but throwing would cost the review. The store
// lives under CONDUCTOR_HOME, never in the repo — a queued comment is a
// machine-local intermediate, not a document.

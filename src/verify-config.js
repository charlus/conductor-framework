// src/verify-config.js
//
// The push gate's configuration: read it, write it, and say what it is in words
// the reader can act on. Shared by `init`, `upgrade`, `conductor verify`,
// `conductor status` and the pre-push hook's message.
//
// WHY. The Verification Iron Law is enforced by `pre-push` running the `verify`
// command from `conductor.config.json`. Measured 2026-09-15 across the
// maintainer's five live projects: ONE had a command. Everywhere else the hook
// printed a one-line "Skipping verify." and the framework's central enforcement
// bet was not running — and nobody noticed, because the message read as
// informational.
//
// Measured again 2026-09-16, after the first fix: the message now named the key
// and the file, and it was STILL unactionable, because `upgrade` never created
// the file it named, and because "nothing to verify" was not a state the config
// could express — so a docs/state repo got the same warning forever. Three
// rules now:
//   1. derive when the files make it deterministic, never guess;
//   2. every message names a command you can paste, not a key you must find;
//   3. OFF can be DECLARED (`"verify": "none"`), so the warning only ever fires
//      at a project that has not decided.

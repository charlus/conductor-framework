# Conductor Enforcement Hooks

> **Why this exists:** the field consensus (Anthropic, Böckeler, Huntley, obra) is blunt — *prose rules are advisory; only code enforces.* Conductor's two headline laws were prose-only. These hooks make them **deterministic** at the git boundary, so they hold even when an agent ignores the prose. See `docs/adr/0001-enforcement-and-autonomy-rebalance.md` (D1). The prose rules stay as the guidance layer; these are the backstop.

## What's here

| Hook | Law | When it fires | Blocks when… |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pre-commit` | **Test-Driven Law** | `git commit` | implementation code is staged with no test change |
| `pre-commit` | **Eval-Driven Law** | `git commit` | code that calls an LLM provider is staged with no eval alongside (waiver: `CONDUCTOR_NO_EVAL="reason"`). See `skills/writing-evals/`. The two gates are independent — waiving one never skips the other. |
| `pre-commit` | **Goodhart boundary** | `git commit` | a test file is deleted, a test is disabled (`.skip`/`.only`/`@pytest.mark.skip`/`#[ignore]`/`t.Skip`/`@Disabled`…), or the staged tests net-lose assertions (waiver: `CONDUCTOR_NO_BOUNDARY="reason"`) |
| `pre-commit` | **Protected paths** | `git commit` | the change edits `.agents/hooks/`, `.agents/rules/`, `.agents/sandbox/` or the reviewer brief (waiver: `CONDUCTOR_NO_PROTECTED="reason"`) |
| `pre-push` | **Verification Iron Law** | `git push` | the configured verification command exits non-zero |
| `verification-stop-hook.sh` | Verification Iron Law (interactive) | Claude Code `Stop` | **opt-in** — code changed since HEAD and verify is red |
| `pretooluse-no-bypass.sh` | every gate above | Claude Code `PreToolUse` | **opt-in** — a Bash call tries to skip the git hooks (`--no-verify`, `-n`, `-c core.hooksPath=`) |
| `pretooluse-fact-gate.sh` | investigate before you write | Claude Code `PreToolUse` | **opt-in** — the first edit/creation of a file, and every destructive command, until the facts are stated (off: `CONDUCTOR_FACT_GATE=off`) |
| `lib.sh` | — | sourced by the others | shared helpers |

### Why the boundary gate exists

The Test-Driven Law proves a test *changed*. It cannot tell a new test from a
deleted one — `--diff-filter=ACM` never sees a deletion, and staging `.skip(`
*is* a change. So the two cheapest ways to reach "all tests pass" — delete the
failing test, skip the failing test — both satisfied it, and gutting the
assertions satisfied it too. A done-criterion needs a boundary beside it: what
the change must **not** do. That is this gate, and it is why the gate is
independent of `CONDUCTOR_NO_TEST` (that waiver says "this change has no test
surface", which is not a licence to remove proof that already exists).

It is deliberately syntactic. A hook cannot judge whether removing a test was
*right* — only that it happened. When it was right, say so in the waiver and
the reason lands in the ship-log.

### Why some paths are frozen

"Build may not edit the acceptance conditions" is the rule every plan/build/judge
loop rests on. The hooks, the always-on rules, the sandbox profile and the
reviewer brief *are* the acceptance conditions, so whatever is being built does
not get to edit what decides whether it passes. Workflows, skills and your
project knowledge stay freely editable — freezing those would make the gate a
tax rather than a boundary.

A `conductor upgrade` legitimately rewrites these paths. Commit it with
`CONDUCTOR_NO_PROTECTED="conductor upgrade"` so the change to your enforcement
surface is a visible decision rather than a silent one.

**The gates judge a change with the copy already committed.** Both hooks load
`lib.sh` from the last commit (at push, from what the remote already has), on
top of the working-tree copy. So deleting, moving or rewriting `lib.sh` cannot
switch the gates off for the commit that does it. And if the committed library
cannot be loaded at all, the hook fails **closed** — it used to fail open,
which let one deleted file disable every gate at once.

**Deleting `pre-commit` is caught at the push.** git runs `pre-commit` from the
working tree, so a commit that deletes it runs no commit gate at all.
`pre-push` refuses a range that removes a hook unless the push carries
`CONDUCTOR_NO_PROTECTED="why"`.

**What no local hook can stop.** git executes `pre-commit` and `pre-push`
themselves from the working tree, so a change that rewrites *both entry
scripts* runs the rewritten versions. That is a property of client-side hooks,
not a gap in these ones. The backstop is server-side — the PR gate and branch
protection — and, for `conductor loop`, the independent Checker, which reviews
the diff that reached the branch rather than trusting the hooks that ran on it.

## Enabling the git hooks

Automatic during `conductor init` / `conductor upgrade` when the target is a git repo (they point `core.hooksPath` at this directory). To (re)install or repair manually:

```bash
conductor install-hooks           # sets core.hooksPath → .agents/hooks
conductor install-hooks --uninstall
```

If you already use a custom `core.hooksPath`, install-hooks won't override it — wire these in yourself.

## Configuring verification

`pre-push` (and the optional Stop hook) run your **verification command**. One command reads and sets it:

```bash
conductor verify                          # what does `git push` run here, and how do I change it?
conductor verify --set "npm test"         # runs it once; only writes it if it passes
conductor verify --detect                 # derive it from the files that are here
conductor verify --none                   # this repo has nothing to verify (docs, state, wrapper)
```

It is resolved in this order:

1. `"verify"` in `conductor.config.json` — e.g. `"verify": "npm test && npm run lint"`
2. `npm test`, if `package.json` defines a `test` script
3. nothing → the push hook prints a notice and allows the push

`--set` runs the command before writing it because a gate that cannot pass is worse than no gate: it
blocks every push and teaches you to reach for `CONDUCTOR_SKIP_VERIFY`. Use `--no-run` to write one
that cannot pass here (CI-only, for instance).

**A repo with nothing to verify** — a state repo, a docs repo, a wrapper whose code lives elsewhere —
should say so with `conductor verify --none`, which records `"verify": "none"`. The hook then stays
silent instead of warning at every push. An unconfigured gate and a declared-off gate look the same to
`git`, but only one of them is a decision, and a warning that can never be cleared is how a safety
message gets ignored.

## Configuring evals (Eval-Driven Law run-gate)

If the repo has evalsets (an `evals/` file or `*.eval.*`), `pre-push` also runs your **eval command** — presence is gated at commit, *passing* is gated here. Resolved in this order:

1. `"eval"` in `conductor.config.json` — e.g. `"eval": "npm run eval"`
2. `npm run eval`, if `package.json` defines an `eval` script
3. nothing → the push hook notes that evalsets exist but no command is set, and allows the push (a gap to close, not a hard block)

```json
{ "verify": "npm test", "eval": "npm run eval" }
```

Non-LLM projects (no eval files) never see this gate.

## Escape hatches (never silent)

Determinism can over-block legitimate config/doc work, so every gate has a logged bypass:

```bash
CONDUCTOR_NO_TEST="config-only change"  git commit …     # TDD gate (pre-commit)
CONDUCTOR_NO_EVAL="stub, no eval surface" git commit …   # Eval presence gate (pre-commit)
CONDUCTOR_NO_BRIEF="pre-A5 spec" git commit …            # brief check (pre-commit)
CONDUCTOR_NO_REPORT="editing an old entry" git commit …  # report shape (pre-commit)
CONDUCTOR_NO_BOUNDARY="feature removed" git commit …     # Goodhart boundary (pre-commit)
CONDUCTOR_NO_PROTECTED="conductor upgrade" git commit …  # protected paths (pre-commit)
CONDUCTOR_SKIP_VERIFY="hotfix, tests offline" git push … # verify gate (pre-push)
CONDUCTOR_SKIP_EVAL="eval infra down" git push …         # Eval run-gate (pre-push)
CONDUCTOR_HOOKS=off git commit …                         # disable all Conductor hooks
```

Every named reason is appended to `conductor/0-compass/ship-log.md`, so a bypass stays auditable. The rule is not *never bypass* — it is *every bypass is logged*. Prefer these over `git commit --no-verify`, which silently skips **every** hook and leaves no trail.

## Optional: the fact gate (Claude Code)

Every other gate here fires **after** the work: the Test-Driven Law and the
Goodhart boundary at commit, the Verification Iron Law at push, the Checker
after the beat. All of them catch a bad change once it exists. None of them
stop a model writing one from a guess.

Self-evaluation does not close that gap — ask a model "are you sure?" and the
answer is always yes. Asking *"which files import this one"* does, because it
cannot be answered without running a search, and running the search puts the
answer in the context. The investigation is the point; the question only
forces it.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Edit|Write|Bash", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.agents/hooks/pretooluse-fact-gate.sh" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

It denies the **first** edit or creation of each file, and **every** destructive
command, naming the facts to state; the retry is allowed. Three questions per
gate:

| Gate | Asks for |
|---|---|
| Edit | every file that imports this one (searched, not recalled); the failing test this makes pass; the instruction verbatim |
| Write | what will call the new file; what you searched to confirm nothing already does this; the instruction verbatim |
| Destructive Bash | exactly what it destroys; a one-line rollback; the instruction verbatim |

**What it does not do:** verify any of it. A `PreToolUse` hook sees the tool
call, not the reasoning. It buys a pause and a prompt at the moment of action —
do not read it as proof. `Read`, `Grep` and `Glob` are never gated; they are the
investigation being demanded. Routine `Bash` is not gated either — ECC's
GateGuard denies it once per session, but our loop runs many commands a beat and
there is no investigation to buy there, only a wasted turn.

After three denials in a session the message condenses to a single line carrying
its ordinal. Identical repeated denials are what push a model into a repetition
loop, so the gate keeps denying but stops repeating itself.

Turn it off with `CONDUCTOR_FACT_GATE=off`, or everything with
`CONDUCTOR_HOOKS=off`. Both `PreToolUse` hooks bound themselves with `timeout`
(`CONDUCTOR_HOOK_TIMEOUT`, default 5s) and fail **open** on expiry: a hook in
front of every tool call must never be able to wedge the session.

## Optional: blocking the unlogged bypass (Claude Code)

`--no-verify` defeats all of the above in one flag, and a sentence in a README is advisory — which is the whole reason these gates are code. Make it a block:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.agents/hooks/pretooluse-no-bypass.sh" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

It denies `git commit --no-verify`, the `-n` shorthand, `git push --no-verify`, `-c core.hooksPath=` overrides and an inline `CONDUCTOR_HOOKS=off`, and the denial names the logged waiver to use instead. It fails **open** on anything unexpected — no node, unparseable input, an unknown shape — because a hook that blocks on its own errors would wedge every Bash call in the session. A quoted mention (`git commit -m "document --no-verify"`) is not a use, and is allowed.

**Reach.** `PreToolUse` is a Claude Code mechanism, so this guards that harness only. On Codex and Antigravity the protection is after the fact, not before: `conductor loop` records a hook-bypassed commit and the improver surfaces the pattern across runs. Detection, not prevention — worth knowing which one you have.

## Optional: interactive Verification hook (Claude Code)

Off by default. To make Claude Code refuse to end a session "done" while your code is red, add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.agents/hooks/verification-stop-hook.sh" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

It only engages when tracked implementation files differ from HEAD, so it won't nag on doc-only or exploratory sessions. Disable anytime with `CONDUCTOR_HOOKS=off` or by removing the entry.

### The stop hook needs your consent once

Hooks **bypass the permission system** — nothing prompts before this one runs your verification command. That command is read from a file *inside the repo* (`conductor.config.json` → `verify`, else the `test` npm script), so a cloned, forked, or contributed repo could name anything. The gate therefore stays inactive until you have read the command and recorded it:

```bash
conductor trust-verify            # shows the command, then records consent
conductor trust-verify --list     # what is trusted, on this machine
conductor trust-verify --revoke   # withdraw it for this repo
```

Trust is keyed on `realpath(repo root)` + `sha256(command)`, stored `0600` at `${CONDUCTOR_HOME:-~/.conductor}/verify-trust`, and every grant is appended to `verify-trust-grants.log`. **Edit the command and it must be trusted again.** Until then the stop hook allows the session to end with a one-line note, and never executes the command.

`pre-commit` and `pre-push` are deliberately *not* gated this way: there you typed `git commit` / `git push`, so a human action is already in the chain.

**Bounded re-entry.** Claude Code re-runs `Stop` hooks after a block. A re-entry is not a free pass — the check re-runs, so a red suite cannot be cleared by stopping again — but it is bounded at 3 blocks per episode, after which the hook allows the session to end with a loud `UNVERIFIED` warning rather than trapping it on a permanently broken check. A green run resets the counter.

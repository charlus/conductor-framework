# Conductor — Verification Iron Law for interactive Claude Code sessions (ADR-0001 D1,
# parallel track). Wire as a `Stop` hook in .claude/settings.json (see hooks/README.md).
# OPT-IN and OFF by default: interactive stop-gating can over-block, so you enable it
# deliberately. When enabled, it refuses to let the session end "done" while tracked
# source files differ from HEAD and the verification command is red.
#
# TRUST BOUNDARY (E4). Hooks bypass the permission system, so the command this hook
# runs executes with no human in the loop — and it is read from a file INSIDE the repo
# (conductor.config.json / package.json). A cloned, forked or contributed repo can
# therefore name any command. So a declared command NEVER runs here until the operator
# has recorded it once, from inside the repo:
#
#     conductor trust-verify
#
# Untrusted (or changed) commands do not block the stop; the hook allows with a one-line
# note naming the fix. Fail-open is correct for this direction: refusing to run an
# unvetted command must not become a way to hold a session hostage, and pre-push still
# enforces the Iron Law at the push boundary where the operator typed the command.
#
# Claude Code passes hook JSON on stdin; exit 2 blocks the stop and feeds stderr back
# to the model. Any other non-zero is a non-blocking error shown to the user.

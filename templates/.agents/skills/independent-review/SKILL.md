description: "The fresh-context review gate. When a workflow produces a consequential artifact — a PRD, an architecture, a spec, a carved plan, a diff — spawn a separate reviewer that did NOT produce it to decide whether it's ready, before it's saved or handed off. This is the Maker/Checker split applied to any artifact. Ship's Phase 4 is its reference implementation; blueprint workflows load it too."

# Independent Review (Fresh-Context Gate)

> The author cannot be their own last reviewer. A mind that just produced an artifact is anchored on the reasoning that produced it — it sees what it *meant*, not what it *wrote*. A reviewer in a **separate, clean context** reads only what's actually there, which is the whole point. This is Conductor's Maker/Checker split (`personas/checker.md`, `skills/subagent-isolation/SKILL.md`) applied to any consequential output, not just code.

**This skill is the caller's half of the gate: when to run it, what to hand the reviewer, and how the cycle terminates.** The reviewer's own instructions are one self-contained file — `reviewer.md` — handed over verbatim. Do not append other skills to it.

## When to run it

Run this gate **once, when a consequential artifact is complete and about to be saved or handed to the next phase** — not per paragraph, not per step.

- **Run it for:** a Grand PRD, a Technical Vision, a Feature Spec + Implementation Plan, a Carve slicing, a shippable diff — anything a later phase will *build on* or a reader will *trust without re-deriving*.
- **Skip it for a diff** that is under **50 changed non-test lines** *and* touches no risk path (auth/session, payments, migrations or schema, API contracts, security, secrets, CI or hooks). The author's two-stage self-review plus a green suite plus the human's own PR read is the gate. Say you skipped it and why.
- **Skip it entirely for** trivial or fully-reversible artifacts (a one-line copy fix, a scratch note).
- **Proportionality is a measured effect, not a preference.** For work comfortably inside the model's capability an independent reviewer is overhead; it earns its cost at the edge — a risky diff, an unfamiliar subsystem, a high-stakes artifact. Scale the reviewer's model tier to the stakes (`skills/model-routing/SKILL.md`); a weak verifier on a high-stakes artifact is a false safety signal.

## The gate

**1. Spawn the reviewer in isolation.** Per `skills/subagent-isolation/SKILL.md`, it runs in a separate, clean context so it isn't biased by the reasoning that produced the artifact:
- **Claude Code:** launch a subagent (Task tool).
- **Antigravity / others:** use the platform's sub-agent primitive.
- **No sub-agent primitive (graceful degradation):** do a deliberate fresh-context pass yourself — re-read **only** the artifact and its source-of-truth inputs, not the conversation that produced it. The gate always runs; only its isolation strength scales with the platform.

**2. Hand it exactly three things.**
- **`skills/independent-review/reviewer.md`** — verbatim, its whole brief.
- **`skills/independent-review/calibration.md`** — when the artifact is consequential (a shippable diff, a loop beat). Skip for a cheap pass.
- **The definition of done + the artifact.** The acceptance criteria (or `goal_description` for a loop beat) plus the review lens below, and the artifact itself — the specific file(s), or `git diff <merge-base>...HEAD` for a diff. Not the whole repo.

**3. It returns findings and one verdict line.** `APPROVE` when there are zero blockers; otherwise `CHANGES REQUESTED`. A BLOCKER carries a quoted line and confidence ≥ 7, per the brief.

**4. It only reports.** The reviewer does not save, merge, push, or edit — the accountable agent fixes and re-verifies (`.agents/rules/verification-iron-law.md`). A subagent's "it's fine" is never the proof.

## Disposing of the findings

Freeze a baseline before the first cycle: the original request, the artifact's intended scope, and its size (changed non-test LOC for a diff; section/Epic/slice count for a blueprint).

| Finding | What you do |
|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | Fix it now, in this cycle. Fix the **class** the reviewer named — including the `also:` list — and verify with the reviewer's own detection method, not a weaker one. Keep the suite GREEN. |
| **IMPORTANT** | Fix it now if it is cheap and in-scope. Otherwise record it in the PR/MR description under **Known gaps**, where the person merging sees it. |
| **NIT** | Author's discretion. Never blocks, never escalates. |
| **`SCOPE:`** | Surface to the human. Do not absorb it, and do not fix around it. |

**No follow-up backlog from review.** A proven in-scope defect is fixed in this cycle or written into the PR body. Deferral lists rot and are never acted on — recording a gap where the merger reads it is honest; filing it into a backlog nobody re-reads is not.

**Dismissing a finding is a valid outcome.** For each one you decide *"deliberate trade-off → dismiss with a one-line reason"* or *"I only told myself it was deliberate — the reviewer is right."* Record the disposition either way (E2's `conductor/1-workbench/review-log.jsonl` when present): a class dismissed most of the time is a rubric defect to fix in `calibration.md`, not an author defect.

## The delta round — capped at one

If the verdict was `CHANGES REQUESTED` and you fixed blockers, re-review **once**, with a **fresh** reviewer and a narrowed brief:

- Round-1 findings **plus your disposition of each one** (`fixed@<sha>` / `dismissed: <reason>` / `known gap`). The reviewer never re-litigates a dismissal it can see the reason for.
- `git diff` of the **fix commits only** — not the whole artifact again.
- Its job, and only this: *are the named classes closed, and did the fix introduce any new blocker?*

**Then it terminates.** One delta round is the cap.

- Delta round returns `APPROVE` → proceed.
- Blockers remain → **stop and ask the human once.** Batch every remaining blocker into a **single question** with each finding, its quote, your recommendation per item, and an overall recommendation. Do not spawn a third reviewer.

**Never escalate an unreviewed fix round.** If the budget or the cap is reached immediately after a fix round, the delta review still runs before you report failure — otherwise you hand back work that may well be complete, having never looked at it. A round that ends without a verdict on its own fixes is not a result.

**Other convergence brakes** (stop, surface the state, let the human decide):
- The fix has grown the artifact past **~2× its frozen scope** without approval.
- The best fix requires **defining a canonical contract first**, or leaves the original boundary.

Hitting a brake is a successful outcome of the gate: it has found that the work is bigger than the request.

## Review lenses (what "ready" means per artifact)

> **Rubric v2** — the reviewer's rubric lives in `reviewer.md` and `calibration.md`; these lenses say what the *definition of done* is for each artifact. Editing either bumps the version; calibrate per `skills/judge-panel/SKILL.md`.

| Artifact | The definition of done the reviewer checks |
|---|---|
| **Grand PRD** (`grand-prd`) | Are the Epics MECE and right-sized? Do they collectively deliver the full transformation — any Storyboard scene lost, any Main-Character outcome unaddressed? Any scope smuggled in that no Satellite justifies? |
| **Technical Vision** (`technical-vision`) | Does the architecture support **every** Epic and serve **every** screen? Is any complexity unjustified (deep-module / deletion test)? Are the ADRs sound and the data model internally consistent? Are the named risks the real ones? |
| **Feature Spec + Plan** (`spec-it`) | Is every acceptance criterion **testable** and unambiguous? Does the plan implement exactly the spec — nothing missing, nothing extra? Is it sliced into thin vertical increments? |
| **Carve slicing** (`carve`) | Does each Implementation deliver testable value on its own? Is the dependency order a valid DAG with no cycles or orphans? Is anything from the Blueprint uncarved, or any slice too big to build safely? |
| **Diff** (`ship`, loop execution) | The spec's acceptance criteria (or `goal_description`), walked as a checklist, plus every item of `conductor/0-compass/architecture-checklist.md` if it exists. For a runtime surface, pair the static read with a source-blind behavior check of the running artifact (`skills/behavior-validator/SKILL.md`) — run by the **author**, its output handed to the reviewer as evidence. |

## In the autonomous loop

- This gate is the natural **blueprint (L2) review step**: when a Maker beat produces a spec or architecture, run the gate before the driver accepts the artifact.
- For **diffs in execution (L3)**, the same split is enforced out-of-process by the independent Checker (`workflows/loop-checker.md`, verdict via `checker-verdict.json`) above the driver's green-verify floor — same rubric, deterministic wiring, and the driver's fail-safe on a missing or malformed verdict is unchanged.
- Route the reviewer's model tier by stakes (`skills/model-routing/SKILL.md`); record it in `0-compass/ship-log.md` so the gate stays auditable.

## Anti-patterns

- The author "reviewing" their own artifact in the same context they wrote it — that's proofreading, not an independent gate.
- A gate per step instead of one gate per artifact — turns review into ceremony and trains the team to rubber-stamp.
- **Withholding APPROVE because more could be built.** The reviewer judges the delivered scope against a stated definition of done; anything else is an unbounded question with no terminating answer.
- **An unbounded reviewer brief.** Loop count tracks the size of the instruction corpus, not the size of the change. One short self-contained brief, not a chain of skills.
- **Blocking on a finding with no quoted evidence** — that is how a nit becomes a round.
- Letting the reviewer edit the artifact — it reports; the accountable agent fixes and re-verifies.
- **Fixing every finding reflexively instead of disposing of it by severity** — a real-but-out-of-scope finding fixed inline is how a narrow change balloons into a rewrite.
- **Absorbing a `SCOPE:` finding silently to keep the loop green** — that is how scope creep hides.
- **Looping the fix cycle without the cap** — one delta round, then a human decides.

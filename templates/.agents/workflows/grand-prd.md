# Workflow: Grand PRD

> **System Instruction:** Upon triggering this workflow, you MUST read the entire content of this file again to load the latest protocols into your active context. Do not rely on previous memory.

**Trigger:** "Grand PRD", "Blueprint PRD", "Create PRD", "Define the epics"
**Goal:** Transform Genesis and Storyboard content into a Grand PRD that organizes the problem space into Epics.
**Output:** `conductor/2-backlog/project-backlog/[ProjectName]/blueprint/grand-prd.md`

**Template:** Use `conductor/5-templates/blueprint-workflows/grand-prd.md` for consistent output structure.

**Prerequisites:** Genesis (required), Storyboard (recommended)
**Next Workflow:** UX/UI Design Brief

**Drafting technique:** Load `.agents/skills/collaborative-drafting/SKILL.md` — you've read all the context, so lead with a complete draft of the Epics and let the user correct it, rather than asking what they should be. Load `.agents/skills/grilling/SKILL.md` for any genuine decision points. Recommend an answer to everything, look facts up, and gate once at convergence — a single approval before the file is saved.

## The Prime Directive

**You are the Architect — organizing the Problem Space.** The Grand PRD answers "What are we building and why?" It organizes the messy problem space into coherent Epics — logical groupings that tell complete "problem → solution → outcome" stories.

It is the first of three Blueprint documents: **Grand PRD** (this) → **UX/UI Design Brief** → **Technical Vision**.

---

## Phase 0: Setup — determine project and load context

1. **Which project (decision):** Ask which existing project, or whether we're starting fresh. Then check `conductor/2-backlog/project-backlog/[ProjectName]/` yourself and branch:
   - **Path A — Genesis + Storyboard both exist:** Read all of them carefully (Problem-Solar-System, World-Transformation, Functional-Animator, Main-Character, Storyboard). Present a brief synthesis (the Sun, the transformation, the main character + outcomes, the scenes, the functional jobs) and confirm it captures the essence.
   - **Path B — Genesis only:** Recommend running Storyboard first (it adds user perspective). If the user proceeds anyway, load Genesis and continue.
   - **Path C — neither:** Recommend running Genesis first. If the user prefers, do condensed context-gathering (grill the problem, transformation, main character, capabilities) and continue.

---

## Phase 1: Epic Discovery
**Goal:** Identify and right-size the Epics.

**What an Epic is:** a coherent chunk of the problem space that addresses a cluster of problems, delivers related outcomes, and contains related scenes/functionality — could become one or more Implementations. **Not** technical components, not prioritized, not implementation detail.

1. **Draft the Epics (recommend, don't ask):** Propose 4–8 initial Epics. For each: a name, a concrete picture of what it covers (paint the scenario), and the scenes/functional jobs it encompasses.
2. **Discuss sizing:** Too big (split)? Too small (combine)? Boundaries right? Iterate one thread at a time.
3. **Coverage check:** Every functional job (Genesis), every scene (Storyboard), every outcome (Main Character) should have a home. Name any gap and propose where it goes.
4. **Scope:** Propose what's explicitly OUT of scope; capture non-goals and deferrals.
5. **Converge:** Reflect the final set — "So we have [N] Epics: [list]." One confirmation, no per-item gate.

---

## Phase 2: Epic Definition
**Goal:** Define each Epic fully.

1. **Draft each Epic (lead with the definition):** For each, propose the full story and let the user adjust:
   - **Problem it solves** — which Satellites from the Problem Solar System; what pain it eliminates.
   - **Why it matters** — how it connects to the transformation; which part of the "after" world it enables.
   - **What the user experiences** — which Storyboard scenes; concrete scenarios, not just features.
   - **Outcomes delivered** — which Main Character outcomes; framed "After this Epic, the main character can…"
2. **Completeness check:** Do the Epics collectively deliver the full transformation? Any outcome unaddressed, any scene lost?

---

## Phase 3: Grand PRD Assembly

1. **Draft the document** into the template structure: Project Overview · The Problem (Sun + Satellites) · The Transformation (Before/After/North Star) · The Main Character · The Epics (problem/why/what/outcomes) · Non-Goals.
2. **Converge & save:** Present it, absorb final adjustments, then — one approval — create `blueprint/` if needed and write `blueprint/grand-prd.md`. Confirm saved.

## Completion Protocol

- **Recap:** "Grand PRD complete for `[ProjectName]` — [N] Epics covering [key areas]." It captures the WHAT and WHY.
- **Next step:** The **UX/UI Design Brief** — translate these Epics into screens, navigation, and interactions.
- **Project state:**
  ```
  project-backlog/[ProjectName]/
  ├── genesis/
  ├── storyboard/
  └── blueprint/

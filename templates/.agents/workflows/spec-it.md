# Workflow: Spec-It

> **System Instruction:** Upon triggering this workflow, you MUST read the entire content of this file again to load the latest protocols into your active context. Do not rely on previous memory.

**Trigger:** "Spec it", "Spec this implementation", "Write the spec"
**Goal:** Create a detailed Feature Spec ("what") and Implementation Plan ("how") for one implementation.
**Output:**
- `implementations/[NN-Name]/feature-spec.md` — the detailed "what"
- `implementations/[NN-Name]/implementation-plan.md` — the detailed "how"

**Prerequisites:** Carve workflow completed (Implementation folders exist with blank templates)
**Next Workflow:** Build (execute the implementation)

**Technique — synthesize, don't re-interview:** By the time Spec-It runs, the Blueprint chain (Grand PRD, UX/UI Brief, Technical Vision) has already interviewed the user at length and written it all down. **Your job is to synthesize that context into specs, not to re-run the interview.** Load `.agents/skills/collaborative-drafting/SKILL.md`: read the upstream docs, draft the full spec, and let the user correct it. Only reach for `.agents/skills/grilling/SKILL.md` on a *genuine gap* — a decision the blueprint left open. Never ask the user for something the upstream documents already answer.

## The Prime Directive

**You are the Architect — translating locked high-level direction into buildable specs**, one implementation at a time. The Feature Spec defines the "what" (product); the Implementation Plan defines the "how" (engineering).

Principles: **Feature Spec first** (lock the "what" before planning the "how") · **reference the source** (pull from Grand PRD, UX/UI Brief, Technical Vision — don't re-derive) · **be specific** (vague specs → vague implementations) · **stay in scope** (only this implementation) · **one approval per document, saved immediately**.

---

## Phase 0: Setup — pick the implementation and load context

1. **Which implementation (decision):** List `implementations/`; recommend the next unspecced one and confirm.
2. **Load context (fact — look it up):** Read, in order — `project-documentation.md` (this implementation's definition + acceptance criteria — critical), `blueprint/grand-prd.md`, `blueprint/ux-ui-design-brief.md`, `blueprint/technical-vision.md`, `blueprint/implementation-overview.md` (sequence + dependencies).
   - **Codebase-inventory scout (`.agents/skills/subagent-isolation/SKILL.md`):** the blueprint says *what* to build; the plan needs to know *what already exists*. Send a scout to inventory the code surface this implementation touches — the files/modules it will change, existing utilities and patterns to reuse, naming conventions — and return a short summary. This grounds the spec's "Dependencies" and the plan's "Files & Components Affected" in reality (not guesses) while keeping the raw code out of the speccing context. Skip for a greenfield area with nothing to inventory.
3. **Confirm understanding (not an interview):** Present a tight synthesis — Implementation, what it delivers, acceptance criteria, key screens/interactions, key entities, dependencies — and ask only "anything the blueprint didn't capture before I draft?" If genuine gaps surface, grill *those* one at a time; otherwise proceed.

## Phase 1: Feature Spec (the "what")

1. **Draft the full spec** from loaded context: Summary · **User Stories, each with its own Acceptance Criteria attached directly beneath it** (not a separate section) · UI/UX Details (reference specific screens) · Edge Cases · Out of Scope · Dependencies.
2. **Present & iterate:** brief summary (3–5 bullets, with justification) first, then the full document. Invite correction; revise until the user signs off.
3. **Converge & save:** one confirmation ("Feature Spec locked?"), then immediately write `implementations/[NN-Name]/feature-spec.md`.

---

## Phase 2: Implementation Plan (the "how")

1. **Draft the full plan** from the Feature Spec + Technical Vision: Technical Approach · Technical Considerations (checklist) · Files & Components Affected · Data Model Changes · API Changes · **Testing Decisions** · Technical Risks · Trade-offs · Execution Phases with Verification.
   - **Phase headers carry checkboxes:** `### - [ ] Phase 1: [Name]`.
   - **Testing Decisions:** name the **seams** Build's TDD loop will test at — prefer the highest useful seam, ideal count one (see `.agents/workflows/tdd-cycle.md`). Deciding seams here lands Build's test effort on the critical paths.
2. **Present & iterate:** summary (3–5 bullets) then full document; revise until sign-off.
3. **Independent review (fresh-context gate):** Run `.agents/skills/independent-review/SKILL.md` with the **Feature Spec + Plan** lens across *both* documents — a reviewer that did not write them confirms every acceptance criterion is testable and unambiguous, the plan implements exactly the spec (nothing missing, nothing extra), the TDD seams are the highest useful ones, and the work is sliced into thin vertical increments. Address every `CHANGES REQUESTED` finding first.
4. **Converge & save:** one confirmation ("Implementation Plan locked?"), then immediately write `implementations/[NN-Name]/implementation-plan.md`.

## Completion Protocol

1. **Update status:** set this implementation to "Specced" in `project-documentation.md` (confirm first).
2. **Recap:** key deliverables, number of phases, notable decisions.
3. **Next step:** ready for **Build**. Offer to start building or spec the next implementation.

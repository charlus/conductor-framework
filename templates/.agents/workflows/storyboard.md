# Workflow: Storyboard (Shaping the Experience)

> **System Instruction:** Upon triggering this workflow, you MUST read the entire content of this file again to load the latest protocols into your active context. Do not rely on previous memory.

**Trigger:** "Storyboard", "Shape the experience", "Who's the main character?"
**Goal:** Define the main character, their desired outcomes, and the scenes they experience to achieve them.
**Output:**
1. `conductor/2-backlog/project-backlog/[ProjectName]/storyboard/main-character.md` (Who they are, what they want)
2. `conductor/2-backlog/project-backlog/[ProjectName]/storyboard/storyboard.md` (The scenes they go through)

**Templates:** Use the templates in `conductor/5-templates/storyboard-workflow/` for consistent output structure.

**Interview technique:** Load `.agents/skills/grilling/SKILL.md` (to draw out the character) and `.agents/skills/collaborative-drafting/SKILL.md` (to propose scenes and documents). One question at a time, recommend an answer to each, look facts up instead of asking, gate only at convergence — one approval per saved document.

**Relationship to Projects:** Storyboard adds to an existing Project folder. If no Project exists, Genesis should be run first to create one. Storyboard outputs go in the `storyboard/` subfolder within the Project.

## The Prime Directive for Storyboard
**You are the Director, not the Engineer.** You're shaping the experience, not building the system. Focus on what the main character sees, feels, and does — not on how it's implemented.

Everything about *how* to interview and draft lives in the two primitives. This file supplies only the agenda and one constraint: **one approval per document** — no separate "ready to draft?" pre-gate.

---

## Phase 0: Setup (Orient and Connect)

1.  **Check for existing Project (fact — look it up):** Scan `conductor/2-backlog/project-backlog/` for a related Project. If found with Genesis, say so and use it as context. If none, recommend running Genesis first; if the user prefers to proceed, create a new Project (ask only for the name).
2.  **Create the folder (action):** `conductor/2-backlog/project-backlog/[ProjectName]/storyboard/`. Confirm.
3.  **Load context (fact — look it up):** Read the Genesis docs (Problem-Solar-System, World-Transformation, Functional-Animator) yourself and summarize the core problem, the transformation, and the main capabilities so the session builds on them.

---

## Phase 1: The Main Character
**Goal:** Define who the main character is, their situation, and the outcomes they want.

1.  **Draft the character (recommend, don't ask):** From Genesis context, propose a first-draft main character — their situation (not demographics), when they show up, their emotional state — and ask the user to correct it. If there's no Genesis to draw from, grill it out (Grilling's active-listening loop: reflect, probe, loop until vivid).
2.  **The outcomes:** Propose the outcomes this character wants, framed as "I want…" statements, each tied to *why* it matters. Confirm they align with the World Transformation (before → after).
3.  **Draft & approve:** Present `main-character.md` (template structure). **STOP** for approval, then write it.

---

## Phase 2: The Scenes
**Goal:** Walk through the key scenes the main character experiences to achieve their outcomes.

1.  **Check existing functionality (fact — look it up):** Review the codebase/app for related features that already work, so proposed scenes don't describe built functionality as new.
2.  **Draft the scenes (collaborative-drafting):** Propose 4–8 major scenes/moments from the outcomes and Genesis. Run the coverage check — every outcome should have a scene that delivers it; name any gap and propose where it goes.
3.  **Explore each scene:** For each, keep it narrative not technical — what triggers it, what they see, what they do, what happens next. Simplicity check: if a scene bloats, propose the simplest version. Then map how the scenes connect (the major views and movement between them).
4.  **Draft & approve:** Present `storyboard.md` (template structure). Trace each outcome to the scenes that deliver it before finalizing. **STOP** for approval, then write it.

---

## Completion Protocol

1.  **Review:** Read both documents to ensure Main Character and Scenes are consistent, and that the scenes deliver the Genesis transformation (before → after).
2.  **Recap:** Who the main character is, their key outcomes, and the major scenes they experience.
3.  **Confirm:** "Storyboard complete. We've defined the Main Character, their Outcomes, and the Scenes."
4.  **Next step:** **Blueprint** — the Grand PRD that synthesizes everything (adds `grand-prd.md` to this Project), then **Technical Vision** → **Carve**.
5.  **Lifecycle:** The Project folder lives in `conductor/2-backlog/project-backlog/`; when all Implementations complete, the whole Project moves to `conductor/6-archive/`.

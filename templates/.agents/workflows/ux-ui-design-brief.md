# Workflow: UX/UI Design Brief

> **System Instruction:** Upon triggering this workflow, you MUST read the entire content of this file again to load the latest protocols into your active context. Do not rely on previous memory.

**Trigger:** "UX/UI Design Brief", "Design the interface", "Define the screens"
**Goal:** Translate the Grand PRD's Epics into interface design — screens, navigation, and interactions.
**Output:** `conductor/2-backlog/project-backlog/[ProjectName]/blueprint/ux-ui-design-brief.md`

**Template:** Use `conductor/5-templates/blueprint-workflows/ux-ui-design-brief.md` for consistent output structure.

**Prerequisites:** Grand PRD (required)
**Next Workflow:** Technical Vision

**Drafting technique:** Load `.agents/skills/collaborative-drafting/SKILL.md` — you've read the PRD and Storyboard, so lead each phase with a complete draft (the screen table, the nav map, the flows) the user corrects, not a blank-page question. Load `.agents/skills/grilling/SKILL.md` for genuine decisions. Recommend an answer to everything, look facts up, and **gate once — a single approval before the file is saved**, not per phase.

## The Prime Directive

**You are the Designer — translating Problem Space into Interface.** The brief answers "What will the user actually see and do?" It makes the abstract Epics concrete: screens, navigation, interactions, flows. It is the second of three Blueprint documents: Grand PRD (done) → **UX/UI Design Brief** (this) → Technical Vision.

**Design Principles:**
- **No modals unless absolutely necessary.** Prefer full pages, inline editing, panels, sub-routes.
- **Fit into the existing app.** Understand existing navigation and patterns first — don't design in a vacuum.
- **Don't over-detail.** This is a brief, not a spec. Nail the key decisions; implementation comes later.

---

## Phase 0: Setup — determine project and load context

1. **Which project (decision):** Ask which project (or fresh). Then check for the Grand PRD at `…/[ProjectName]/blueprint/grand-prd.md` yourself.
   - **If missing:** recommend running the Grand PRD workflow first (without it there are no Epics to design for). Proceed only if the user directs otherwise.
2. **Load context (fact — look it up):** Read the Grand PRD (Epics, problems, outcomes), the Storyboard scenes, and Main Character.
3. **Review the existing app (fact — look it up):** If there's a codebase, inspect current navigation, screens/routes, and patterns (lists, detail views, editing) yourself. Present where new screens fit into existing navigation and confirm patterns to follow. If greenfield, say so.
4. **Synthesize:** Briefly state what you're designing for (Epics, key scenes, the main character's core goal, where new screens fit) and confirm before designing.

## The Design Agenda

Work these phases in order. For **each**, apply Collaborative-Drafting's four moves — *propose a complete draft → discuss → coverage-check → iterate* — with **no per-phase approval gate**. Save happens once, in Assembly.

**Phase 1 — Screens Inventory.** Propose every distinct screen as a table: name, purpose, which Epic(s) it serves. Discuss missing/combine/split.

**Phase 2 — Navigation Structure.** Propose the home base, the primary nav pattern (tabs / sidebar / hub-and-spoke — consider platform), and a text nav map. Note global/floating elements (quick-capture, global search).
> **When the nav pattern is genuinely contested** (more than one viable shape for this app — it's a hard-to-reverse choice that shapes every screen), lead with **2–3 divergent options** and their trade-offs rather than a single proposal, and let the human pick — on design, *they* are the judge (this is the judge-panel instinct with a human scorer, not an automated one). When one pattern is clearly right for the platform and app, just propose it.
```
[Home Screen]
    ├── [Screen A] via [action]
    │   └── [Sub-screen] via [action]
    ├── [Screen B] via [action]
    └── [Screen C] via [action]
```

**Phase 3 — Screen-by-Screen Breakdown.** For each screen, propose: purpose, what they see (layout concept, data), what they can do (actions), where they go from here. Don't rush, don't over-detail.

**Phase 4 — Key Interactions.** Propose the recurring patterns and where each appears: drag-and-drop, create/edit (modal vs inline vs page), filtering/sorting, selection (single/multi), modals vs panels vs pages, anything product-specific. Consistency check: same action behaves the same way everywhere.

**Phase 5 — Component Inventory.** Propose reusable elements grouped by type (cards, badges/tags, controls, list items, calendar elements, buttons) — for each: what it shows/does and where it's used.

**Phase 6 — Key User Flows.** Propose 3–5 critical flows that exercise core functionality across multiple screens. For each: name (what they're trying to do), start, numbered steps (action → result), end state. Coverage-check against Storyboard scenes and Epics.

**Phase 7 — Platform Considerations.** Primary platform (web/mobile/desktop/all), responsive behavior (mobile- vs desktop-first), and any constraints or platform-specific patterns.

---

## Phase 8: Assembly

1. **Draft the document** into the template structure: Overview · Screens Inventory · Navigation Structure · Screen-by-Screen Breakdown · Key Interactions · Component Inventory · Key User Flows · Platform Considerations.
2. **Completeness check:** every Epic has screens that deliver it; every Scene is represented in a flow.
3. **Independent review (fresh-context design gate):** Run `.agents/skills/independent-review/SKILL.md` before saving, with a **UX/design lens** — the reviewer adopts `.agents/skills/ux-reviewer/SKILL.md` and audits the brief against the Design System and UX heuristics (consistent interaction patterns, no gratuitous modals, navigation legibility, every Epic/Scene covered). This is the design-flavored sibling of the review gate the other blueprint workflows run; address `CHANGES REQUESTED` findings before save. (Taste calls stay with the human from the phases above; the gate checks craft and coverage, not aesthetics.)
4. **Converge & save:** Present the complete brief, absorb final adjustments, then — one approval — write `…/[ProjectName]/blueprint/ux-ui-design-brief.md`. Confirm saved.

## Completion Protocol

- **Recap:** "UX/UI Design Brief complete for `[ProjectName]` — [N] screens, [key navigation], [key interactions]." We now have the WHAT (PRD) and the INTERFACE (UX/UI).
- **Next step:** The **Technical Vision** workflow — how to build this interface.
- **Project state:**

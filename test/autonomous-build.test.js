// D1 — Build runs to ship-ready without asking permission to continue.
//
// Real usage (autopportunity, eurassistant, 2026-10) showed the product owner
// answering "Ready for batch 3; GO ahead" again and again, then writing "build
// until the slice is ready to be shipped" and "don't bother me just for me to
// tell you to continue". The fix lived in per-project agent memories instead of
// the workflow. A batch is the unit of independent review, not a stop. Long
// builds survive a context reset through the task tracker, not through a human
// saying "continue".
//
// Pinned here: no confirmation stop is left in Build, the stop conditions are
// the product-decision set, and the tracker is named as the state to resume from.

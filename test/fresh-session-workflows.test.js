// test/fresh-session-workflows.test.js
//
// The planning chain runs one workflow per session. A fresh session knows
// nothing, so each step must (1) end by printing the next command WITH the
// folder to read, and (2) start by reading a folder given to it instead of
// asking. Before this, Carve, Technical Vision and Build named no project at
// all — they relied on the old conversation already knowing it.
//
// Structural, and honest about it: this proves the instructions are present.
// Whether a fresh agent follows them is proven by a live run, not here.

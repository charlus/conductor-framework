# The Goodhart boundary + protected paths — pre-commit BEHAVIOR test (F9/F12).
#
# The Test-Driven Law proves a test CHANGE exists. It cannot tell a new test
# from a deleted one: `--diff-filter=ACM` never sees a deletion, and staging
# `.skip(` counts as a test change. So "all tests pass" was gameable by the two
# cheapest moves an unattended agent has — delete the failing test, or skip it.
# The boundary gate closes that, and the protected-path gate stops the agent
# editing the gates themselves (Build may not edit the acceptance conditions).
#
# Installs the REAL templates/.agents/hooks into a temp repo and exercises both.

# Outward Rigour — pre-commit brief-check gate BEHAVIOR test (A5 / D1).
# Installs the real templates/.agents/hooks into a temp repo and exercises the
# gate: a feature-spec.md staged without a "Brief check" section is blocked;
# with the section, or with a logged waiver, it commits; other markdown is
# untouched. Presence is gated, not quality — same call as the Eval-Driven Law.

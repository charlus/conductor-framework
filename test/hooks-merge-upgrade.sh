# Merging a newer Conductor into an older branch — BEHAVIOUR test (F11).
#
# autopportunity, 2026-10: a branch cut before an upgrade merged main. The merge
# had a conflict, so `git commit` ran pre-commit, which loads lib.sh from HEAD:
# the OLD branch's library, missing the newer helpers. It failed closed with
# "That is normal for the one commit that upgrades Conductor itself", and the
# agent bypassed it with CONDUCTOR_NO_PROTECTED. During a merge, the library of
# the branch being merged (MERGE_HEAD) is committed too, and is used instead;
# a protected file staged exactly as MERGE_HEAD has it is not this change's edit.

// Hook registry drift (F3).
//
// ECC pins its hook graph with a fingerprinted sidecar so a reorder or an
// edited command that skips the sidecar fails CI. We have no hooks.json to
// mirror, so copying the sidecar would be cargo cult. What we DO have is three
// places that must agree and are only kept in sync by someone remembering:
//
//   1. the hook files on disk
//   2. the table in hooks/README.md that tells the user they exist
//   3. EXECUTABLE_HOOKS in install-hooks.js, which sets the executable bit
//
// Adding this session's two gates I had to update all three by hand, and
// missing (3) would have shipped a hook that silently never runs. That is the
// drift worth pinning.
//
// Deliberately NOT a content checksum. A hash that fails on every legitimate
// edit gets regenerated without being read, which is how a safety check gets
// trained out. These assert AGREEMENT between sources, not immutability.

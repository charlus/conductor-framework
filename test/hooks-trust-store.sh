# test/hooks-trust-store.sh — E4 behavior test for the verify-command trust
# boundary and the bounded stop-hook re-entry.
#
# This is a BEHAVIOR test, not a structural one: it builds a throwaway repo,
# runs the real `conductor trust-verify` (Node) and the real stop hook (bash),
# and asserts on exit codes and on whether the declared command actually ran.
# The cross-implementation check matters most — the hook reads a store the CLI
# wrote, and a hash-format disagreement between them would silently disable the
# gate while every other suite stayed green.

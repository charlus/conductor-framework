// F8 — lessons go to conductor/, not to one agent's private memory.
//
// Real usage (website, 2026-10): after a correction the agent said "I have saved
// that as a working rule for future sessions" — in its harness memory. The
// product owner: "If it is in your own memory that useless, you are not the
// only one working on the project, the more robust way to do it is in the
// conductor files." In autopportunity and eurassistant the "build without
// checkpoints" rule also lived only in agent memories. Nothing in the always-on
// block said where a lesson belongs.

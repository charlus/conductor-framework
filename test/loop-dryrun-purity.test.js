// test/loop-dryrun-purity.test.js
//
// Regression for the revive/lock-ordering finding (PR #7 review). Before the fix,
// `loopCommand` persisted the resume-revive (and any trigger/harvest) to disk
// UNCONDITIONALLY, before the `--dry-run` guard and before the one-loop lock. Two
// bugs followed: (1) `--dry-run` mutated loop-state.json on an interrupted state
// (rewound in-flight tasks to `pending`), contradicting "dry-run never writes";
// (2) a 2nd invocation racing a live run rewound the live run's on-disk tasks
// before the lock refused it.
//
// This is an INTEGRATION test — it drives the real `loopCommand` IO shell, the
// exact layer the pure-module suites stub out (the documented adapter-layer trap),
// which is why the original bug was invisible to them. `--dry-run` returns before
// spawning any agent, so no real CLI is launched.

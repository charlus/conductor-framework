// Unattended Lifecycle step 4 (D1, D5): a stage that meets a one-way door does
// not stop the run and does not decide alone. It writes one round of numbered
// questions, each with options, a recommendation and the cost of a wrong
// choice; a fresh Checker confirms each is a real one-way door answerable cold;
// the item pauses while other work goes on; the owner answers by number; the
// next run resumes the item. `conductor status` measures how often the owner
// takes the recommendation and overrules a ruling.

## Q1. Where do synced notes live?
Writers want their notes on every device. The spec does not say where the notes are stored between devices.

1. Our own server — every note reaches us; one more service to run and pay for.
2. The writer's own cloud drive — we store nothing; setup is harder for the writer.

**Recommendation:** 2, because the PRD promises "your notes stay yours".
**If wrong:** moving storage later means migrating every writer's notes.

Answer:

## Q2. Do deleted notes come back?
A deleted note can be kept for 30 days or removed at once.

1. Keep for 30 days — a writer can undo a mistake.
2. Remove at once — nothing lingers.

**Recommendation:** 1, because undo is cheap to offer and costly to add later.
**If wrong:** notes a writer wanted gone stay for a month.

Answer: 1

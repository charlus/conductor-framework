// A5 — the framework challenges the brief, not only the code.
//
// Every gate Conductor owns is inward: TDD, the Eval-Driven Law, the evidence
// ledger, independent-review, the Checker. All prove the code does what the
// spec says; none check whether the spec was worth building. A PO running
// several products against an agent fleet gets no challenge from anyone with a
// stake in the outcome.
//
// Bounded to four detectable conditions (C1 contradicts an earlier decision,
// C2 breaks existing users, C3 cost/duration mismatch, C4 missing data, access
// or rights) rather than an open "is this a good idea" — an unbounded question
// is what stopped the review gate converging (memory/review-loop-root-cause).
//
// Maintainer decisions, PR #28: D1 enforce presence, D2 extend grilling rather
// than add a skill, D3 non-blocking to the human, D4 current project only.
// D2 carried an addition: the shared understanding reached at convergence is
// the artifact worth keeping, so it gets written down, not just agreed.

// A4 — the async surfaces report to a PO, not to an engineer.
//
// The maintainer reads the loop's output asynchronously: a ship-log entry, a
// PR body, and `conductor status`. All three were engineering-shaped. The
// ship-log's six fields were quality, platform and a three-line retrospective;
// the PR body had no shape at all beyond "link issues, summarise the review";
// and `status` answered "what is on our plate" with counts and freshness, so
// nothing anywhere answered "what is waiting on me" across 4-6 products.
//
// Maintainer decisions, 2026-09-16: restructure the ship-log into two blocks
// (For you / For the record) rather than appending four fields to six, and
// surface unanswered `Decide:` lines at the top of `conductor status`.
//
// The `For you` block is gated in pre-commit for the same reason the brief
// check is: a rule that only lives in workflow prose is advisory.

## 2026-09-16 — Retry on dropped login

**For you**
- Impact: users stop seeing a blank screen on flaky mobile
- Cost: none, no new service
- Risk: retry storm if the API degrades, not load-tested
- **Decide:** none

**For the record**
- Quality: empathy audit passed, 3 regression tests, review APPROVE
- Platform: branch \`fix/login-retry\` — https://example.invalid/mr/1

- ⚠️ 2026-09-16T10:00 Hook waiver (TDD): generated client

## 2026-09-14 — Search results paging

**For you**
- Impact: results past page 1 are reachable
- Cost: none
- Risk: none
- **Decide:** keep 50k document cap, or fund Elasticsearch this quarter?

**For the record**
- Quality: review APPROVE

## 2026-07-02 — Legacy entry
- **What:** something old

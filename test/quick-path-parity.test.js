// F3 — Quick-Path keeps the gates that Build and Ship add.
//
// Real usage (evalapp-v2, 2026-10): both features built after 6.8 went through
// Quick-Path. Quick-Path said only "follow the Build workflow". The agent read
// the first 80 lines of build.md and never reached the persona step or the
// reviewer.md handover. No persona was loaded (the Designer was needed), the
// review used an improvised prompt, nothing reached review-log, and the agent
// opened the MRs itself, so Ship never ran and no ship-log entry was written.
// In autopportunity the spec Quick-Path saved had no `## Brief check`, which the
// pre-commit hook then blocked at ship time.
//
// Pinned here: the steps that were skipped are written in Quick-Path itself,
// and the spec it saves passes the hook.

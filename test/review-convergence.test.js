// E1 — the review gate must CONVERGE. Guards the contract that stops the
// review loop from running forever:
//
//   1. One reviewer brief exists and is SHORT (agentctl measured loop count
//      tracking the size of the instruction corpus: steps with 0-118 lines of
//      rules closed in one loop, steps with 1,662-4,830 lines took 15-21).
//   2. A BLOCKER needs EVIDENCE (a quoted line + confidence >= 7), so an
//      unsure reviewer downgrades instead of rejecting.
//   3. The reviewer judges against a STATED definition of done, so "is this
//      finished?" is a bounded question with a reachable answer.
//   4. The unbounded-review phrasings that caused the loop are GONE.
//   5. The fix cycle is CAPPED at one delta round, then a human decides.
//
// These are DRIFT GUARDS on prose, not behavior tests — prose cannot be
// executed. The behavior proof for the verdict schema is E3
// (parseCheckerVerdict red->green) and the routing eval; the proof that the
// loop got shorter is E2's review ledger measured over real ships. Stated
// plainly here so a green run is not mistaken for a working review gate
// (CLAUDE.md Operating Truth 1).

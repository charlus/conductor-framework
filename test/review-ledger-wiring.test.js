// O7 — the review ledger is written by the workflow that produces findings.
//
// E2 shipped `conductor review-log append|summary` (2026-09-03) so the review
// gate's convergence could be a number: rounds to APPROVE, dismissal rate per
// class, blockers by category. Measured 2026-09-15: zero rows in all five live
// projects. Not a habit problem — `templates/` never told the agent to append;
// only `calibration.md` mentioned the file, as a READER. An instrument nothing
// writes to is decoration, and E1's "good enough" rests on feel until it fills.
//
// Pinned here: Ship's disposition step (4.4) and the review skill's disposition
// rule both name the append command, with the record shape the CLI validates
// (`severity`, `category`, `action`, and for a BLOCKER a `quote` + `confidence`).

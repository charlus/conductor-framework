// test/ship-tail.test.js
//
// The Ship workflow's tail was being dropped. Measured 2026-09-15 across the
// maintainer's four live projects: the last ship-log entry was dated
// 2026-07-16 / 07-31 / 07-31 while 103 / 8 / 18 merges landed on main after
// it, and retrospectives existed for 12 of 47 logged ships. The cause is
// structural, not laziness: the MR was created in Phase 5 and the ship-log,
// product-area update and archive move sat in Phase 6, after the visible
// deliverable, with the Retrospective an optional Next Step. An agent treats
// the MR as the finish line and stops.
//
// Two decisions this test pins:
//   O1  bookkeeping is a PRECONDITION of the MR step, not an afterthought —
//       it must appear before `glab mr create` / `gh pr create`, in the
//       phases and in the completion checklist alike.
//   O3  a minimal retrospective lives INSIDE the ship-log entry (three
//       fields), so a ship with no separate Retrospective still leaves a
//       lesson behind, and one grep across every project finds what the
//       framework itself should learn.
//
// Structural on prose, and honest about it: this proves the order and the
// fields are in the instructions, not that an agent obeys them. Whether the
// ship-logs resume is measured the same way the gap was found — by diffing
// the last entry date against merges on main.

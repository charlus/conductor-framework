// F11 — small defects seen in real usage (2026-10).
//   - Ship archived only from conductor/1-workbench/. Carve puts slices under
//     2-backlog/project-backlog/<P>/implementations/, so 18 shipped slices in
//     autopportunity were never archived until the owner asked.
//   - how-it-works sent "I know exactly what to build" to Quick-Path OR Spec-It,
//     but Spec-It requires Carve. The product owner ran /spec-it twice on
//     uncarved features and the agent reversed its own recommendation.
//   - `"eval": "none"` was not understood: a repository whose evals are run by
//     hand (website-cms) got the "not enforced" notice on every push.

//
// O4 — verify the live system before the spec is written.
//
// Four retrospectives in two projects, spread over four months, asked for the
// same thing and none of them reached the framework:
//   2026-03-13  an API type code was trusted from its label ("HR" was 144, not 4)
//   2026-06-22  a new ID format was introduced and three sibling endpoints missed
//   2026-07-14  consumers authenticated differently than assumed; the CI config
//               silently skipped the whole unit suite ("read conftest.py early")
//   2026-07-24  "the original source mapping was wrong and survived ~4 months in
//               the specs" — "run live API + credential discovery up front"
// Carve and Spec-It had no step that turns an assumption about the outside
// world into a fact, and Retrospective's only route for a workflow lesson was
// "note it for future framework updates", which has no destination.
//
// Three decisions pinned here:
//   * Spec-It probes BEFORE Phase 1 writes the Feature Spec, and the spec
//     carries the result as `Verified:` / `Assumed:` lines, so a reader can
//     tell a checked fact from a guess.
//   * Carve's per-slice cross-check asks whether what the slice relies on
//     exists TODAY in the source system, not in the blueprint.
//   * Retrospective routes workflow lessons to the ship-log's
//     `Framework lesson` line (see test/ship-tail.test.js), which one grep
//     finds across every project.
//
// Structural on prose. It proves the step is in the instructions, not that an
// agent runs it — whether wrong-assumption rework stops is read from the
// `Surprised:` lines that ships write from now on.

// `conductor survey` — the facts about an inherited codebase (F15).
//
// Genesis assumes a blank page. A product owner who has just inherited a
// running product has the opposite problem: the code is the only honest
// record of what it does, and nobody left to ask. There was no path from
// code to `conductor/`.
//
// Split on purpose, and the split is the point: a SCRIPT collects facts
// exhaustively and an AGENT judges them. Everything here is the script half,
// so it is deterministic, testable, and cannot flatter itself. The workflow
// reads what this prints; it never asks the model what it remembers seeing.

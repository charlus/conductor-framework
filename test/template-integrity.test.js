// E5 — the drift gate for `templates/.agents/`.
//
// WHY A GATE AND NOT A GENERATOR. gstack generates its SKILL.md files from
// templates and gates freshness with `--dry-run && git diff --exit-code`. That
// is the right answer for them because their skill docs are largely mechanical
// (a command table derived from source). Ours are not: `registry.json` and
// `how-it-works.md` carry hand-written descriptions and a curated routing
// table, and those are the most valuable prose in the repo. Generating them
// would destroy information to solve a problem we do not have.
//
// The problem we DO have is drift: add a skill or a workflow, forget to wire it
// up, and nothing notices. This gate caught two real ones on its first run:
//
//   * `agentic-flow.md` shipped in every install and was DOCUMENTED (a row in
//     the Cross-Cutting table, an entry in registry.json) but no file path or
//     trigger pointed at it, so a user typing "design a flow" could never
//     reach it. Documented is not the same as routable — which is precisely
//     why this check looks for a reference to the FILE, not a mention of the
//     name.
//   * `loop-checker.md` and `unattended-loop.md` had empty descriptions in
//     registry.json, so the one place an agent looks a workflow up said
//     nothing about what they do.
//
// Structural checks, and honest about it: they prove a file is REACHABLE, not
// that the routing is good. Whether the model actually picks the right workflow
// is the routing eval's job (test/evals/routing-eval.mjs).

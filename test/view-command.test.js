//
// The `--out` escape hatch is the one path where a derived view can reach a
// commit. `conductor view` with no flags writes into `conductor/.views/` and
// adds the ignore entry itself, so the page is invisible to `git status` and to
// `git add -A`. `--out <path>` means "write it exactly here" — often outside the
// repo entirely — so silently editing `.gitignore` for an arbitrary path would
// be wrong. A warning is the honest middle: say so, let the human decide.
//
// The decision is a pure function of git's own answer, so the ignore semantics
// are git's rather than a reimplementation of them here.
